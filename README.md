# My Functions Olympic Challenge
This repository is my solution to DBServer's Start DB challenge.  
It consists in creating my own versions of Find, Some, Filter, Map and Reduce functions and solve 5 challenges using fake data from the olympics.  
The challenge you can find [here](https://github.com/dbserver/challenge-olympics-myfunctions).
