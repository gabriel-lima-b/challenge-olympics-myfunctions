# My Functions Olympic Challenge
This repository is my solution to DBServer's Start DB challenge.  
It consists in creating my own versions of Find, Some, Filter, Map and Reduce functions and solve 5 challenges using fake data from the olympics.  
The challenge you can find [here](https://github.com/dbserver/challenge-olympics-myfunctions).

I tried to mimic the functions behavior looking on the [documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) definition and wrote some test cases using basic [jest](https://jestjs.io/) to verify if my code was working.
